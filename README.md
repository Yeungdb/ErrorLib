# ErrorLib
Essentially, I want a convenient way to do error analytics in production where we setup Exception Handling situations with code that will notify our Error Logging server of the type of error and the nature of the environment of where the error occurred for easier debugging and error mitigation down the road. This will be separate from the SSRCalc app we are building but will be part of the ecosystem. This project will be ‘open-access’ but have not yet decided on whether it will be open-source. Ideally, I would like this to be a standalone library that we can deploy to PyPI and alongside I would like to have a terminal-based UI to access the Error Logging database. 

This type of error logging library will be beneficial for all forms of development, but what I have in mind would be useful for server/backend development. We can eventually adapt this library into other languages (which should be straight forward given the low complexity of this library) but primarily we will be targeting Python. Beyond backend, other forms of Python development such as Machine Learning with PyTorch can be easily managed with a library like this. This can ease users ability to identify key pain points in an application and develop more robust infrastructure.
